The repository is for SALESFORCE LIGHTNING Training purpose
We've created two apps for now, but have planned for five apps- >
 
1.       First one implements basic input, form handling and validation
2.       Second one implements account list to be shown  by setting aura attribute.
 
Third app which will show insertion of account records via form input using my custom CRUD lightning component . ( This will include usage of ui:picklist  )
Fourth app will show the use of custom controller in lightning component and how to fetch data from it via wrapper classes in form of javascript object.
Fifth app will show Use of my custom made lightning lookup component to insert contact or custom object as child of account. This will include populating
Contact or any custom object picklist using account picklist.
 
                P.S. - Iâ€™ve used SLDS  + custom css in my second app.
